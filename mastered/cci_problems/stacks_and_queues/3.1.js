/*
	We would have a single array, say initiializing at capacity 24, in which the capacity is divided into 3.  Each array has a 
	start Idx, a capacity, and a currenty length.  Is empty is checked via length === 0.  peek checked via startIdx + length - 1.  Pop
	works similarly.  Push increments. yadayadayada
